alt="Untitled picture.png Key properties of complex conjugation that we discussed in the last topic were the rules &#10;3) (zw) &#10;and &#10;and &#10;w) &#10;There is one more rule that will be useful to state explicitly: &#10;This means that a complex number z is actually a real number precisely when z &#10;to demonstrate step by step. Suppose that z is a solution to the equation &#10;Then if we take the complex conjugate of both sides, we get &#10;The justification for this step is [select all that apply]: &#10;Rule 1 &#10;So then &#10;which is justified by &#10;Rule 1 &#10;Next we rewrite this as &#10;Rule 2 &#10;Rule 2 &#10;which is justified by [select all that apply] &#10;Rule 1 &#10;So we get that &#10;which is justified by &#10;Rule 1 &#10;Rule 2 &#10;Rule 2 &#10;Rule 3 &#10;Rule 3 &#10;Rule 3 &#10;Rule 3 &#10;Rule 4 &#10;Rule 4 &#10;Rule 4 &#10;Rule 4 &#10;Rule 5 &#10;Rule 5 &#10;Rule 5 &#10;Rule 5 &#10;S.
